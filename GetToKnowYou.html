   <p>Hello all, my name is Beau Hatch, I am 22 years old, and I live in the salt lake valley. Outside of school, I like to ride my scooter and skateboard, paint with watercolors, sew clothes, play the guitar and I like film photography. My favorite bands recently are Part Time, King Krule, King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, The Growlers, and Peach pit. My major is the applied technology thing and I am taking classes in coding and graphic design. The plan is to continue my studies and get a job doing coding or graphic design. This is my fifth semester at BYUI. I also served a mission in El Salvador. Very cool place. I think good writing makes you feel emotion or spark interest. I consider myself a beginner writer. I look forward to getting to know you people. God bless.</p>
